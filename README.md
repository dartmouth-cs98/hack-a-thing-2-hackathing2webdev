# Hack-a-thing 2
## Will Sanford

### What we attempted to build
My main goal in this Hack-A-Thing was to gain a general knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript. I have never taken any WebDev classes or done any personal web dev projects, so generally I wanted to get as familir with the landscape as I could in a few days. I did not know how far I would get in the tutorial as it is quite long. I certainly need a lot more practice and I will continue looking through more of this course. I do think that I am at a point where I could start actively contributing to building a website.


### Who did what
All of what I did was contained in the Code Academy 'We Development' course. I did the following sub modules:

* Learn HTML 
* Styling a Website
* Getting Started with JavaScript
* Getting More Advanced with Design
* Building Interactive JavaScript Websites
* Intermidiate JavaScript

I did some of the 'Projects' contained within these moduels. These are the Projx folders. I stopped doing these as they were taking the most time and I didnt feel like I was learning as much as going through the normal course.

### What you learned 
I think this course did quite a good job at teaching the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, specifically in learning the basics of JavaScript and how to integrat interactivity into a website. I definetly came away with what I wanted in a understanding of the basic Web Development landscape.

### What didn't work
Its hard to know what you don't know. The course was very structured. Every problem they presented they stepped through step by step. I feel like I have the information contained in it down somewhat well. I will in all likelyhood run into a new applicaiton of these ideas/languages that I simply don't know how to deal with. Also I did not get super far into the course, so I havn't seen React, Databases and other more advanced concepts. overall I think I have the basics down well.
